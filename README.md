# üå± Projects
Here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills and expertise:

## Red Wine Quality Classification using Random Forest
This project is a machine learning application that predicts the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties. The dataset used for this task is the Red Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The main goal of this project is to train a classification model that can accurately predict the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties. To achieve this goal, we used a Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.Check out the [repository](https://github.com/amirhosseinzinati/Red-Wine-Quality-Random-Forest-Classification) for more information.

## Estimating Fish Weight Using Linear Regression
This project explores the relationship between various measurements of fish and their weight, with the goal of building a linear regression model to accurately estimate the weight of a fish based on its measurements. The dataset used for this project includes measurements of several fish species, including their length, height, width, and weight. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/amirhosseinzinati/Estimating-Fish-Weight-Using-Linear-Regression) for more information.

## Rice Classification using MobileNet
This project aims to classify five different types of rice - Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag - using the MobileNet model. With an accuracy of 99%, our model can accurately classify the rice types based on their unique features.Check out the [repository](https://github.com/amirhosseinzinati/Rice-Classification) for more information.

## Harry Potter Characters Detection Using YOLOv8 Model
This project uses the YOLOv8 model to detect Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger in movies. We trained the model on a custom dataset of Harry Potter movie frames.

## Cat vs Dog Classifier
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs. I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/amirhosseinzinati/Cat-dog-classification-using-CNN) for more information.

## Generate Anime Faces Using GAN (DCGAN)
TThis project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate anime faces. DCGAN is a type of generative model that can learn to generate realistic images by training on a large dataset of images.Check out the [repository](https://github.com/amirhosseinzinati/Generate-Anime-Faces-Using-GAN-DCGAN-) for more information.
